    How does the Public Whip
    work?
%p
  Debate transcripts of the House of Representatives and the
  Senate are published online as #{link_to "Hansard", "http://www.openaustralia.org/"}.
  Public Whip takes these records and compiles lists of votes that you can
  access under #{link_to "Divisions", divisions_path}. You can search through
  these votes using our #{link_to "search function", root_path} on the home
  page or you can browse the votes that are relevant to the particular policy
  areas listed under #{link_to "Policies", policies_path} (for more on our
  policies, see #{link_to "What are Policies and how do they work?", "#policies"}).
%h2.faq
  %a{:name => "timeperiod"}
    What time period does it
    cover?
%p
  The Public Whip’s voting and membership data extends back to
  2006. New divisions are added as soon as possible after becoming
  available. We give no warranty for the data so
  %a{:href => "#contact"} let us know
  if you find any factual
  inaccuracies.
%p
  %b Numerics:
  The database contains
  %strong= number_with_delimiter(Member.select(:person_id).distinct.count)
  distinct Representatives and Senators from
  %strong= number_with_delimiter(Member.select(:party).distinct.count)
  parties who have voted across
  %strong= number_with_delimiter(Division.count)
  divisions. In total
  %strong= number_with_delimiter(Vote.count)
  votes were cast giving an average of
  -# Doing this to make it match the php app as a quick hack
  - if Vote.count.to_f / Division.count == 1.0
    %strong 1
  - else
    %strong= number_with_precision (Vote.count.to_f / Division.count), precision: 1, strip_insignificant_zeros: true
  per division. Of these
  %strong= number_with_delimiter(Member.joins(:member_info).sum(:rebellions).to_i)
  were against the majority vote for their party giving an average rebellion rate of
  <strong>#{Member.joins(:member_info).sum(:rebellions) == 0 ? "0%" : "#{number_with_precision((Member.joins(:member_info).sum(:rebellions).to_f / Vote.count.to_f * 100), precision: 2, strip_insignificant_zeros: true)}%"}</strong>.
%h2.faq
  %a{:name => "division"} What is a division?
%p
  A division is a formal vote on a motion in the House of
  Representatives or the Senate. A motion is a formal proposal put to
  the House or Senate to take action of some kind.
%p
  When a division is called on a particular motion, Members of
  Parliament (MPs) in the House of Representatives or Senators in the
  Senate divide themselves into two groups: one that votes Aye (yes)
  and one that votes No. Each political party has whips who try to
  persuade their members to vote along party lines.
%h2.faq
  %a{:name => "division-occur"}
    When does a division
    occur?
%p
  Most decisions in Parliament are made
  %a{:href => "http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/voting-in-the-chambers.html"}
    ‘on
    the voices’
  and not by division. When a question is asked by
  the Chair, the Members of Parliament (MPs) or Senators call out Aye
  (yes) or No and the Chair decides which are in the majority without
  recording the names of who voted and how they voted.
%p
  A division is only called if two or more MPs or Senators call
  for one. If only one MP or Senator calls for a division then their
  name may be recorded in the official record (the Hansard) but no
  division will occur.
%p
  In the House of Representatives, if there are four or less MPs
  on a side of the division then the division does not proceed and
  the Speaker declares the decision of the House immediately.
  However, the names of the MPs in the minority are recorded.
%p
  In the Senate, if there is only one Senator on a side of the
  division then the division does not proceed and the President
  declares the decision of the Senate immediately. However, the names
  of the lone Senator may be recorded.
%h2.faq
  %a{:name => "decisions"}
    Why don’t all decisions made
    in Parliament appear on Public Whip?
%p
  Public Whip is concerned with the voting patterns of
  politicians, which means it is limited to formal votes (known as
  divisions, see
  = succeed ")." do
    %a{:href => "#division"} What is a division?
  This
  is because politicians’ names and how they voted are only recorded
  in the official record of Parliament (known as the Hansard) when a
  division occurs.
%p
  Unfortunately, most decisions in Parliament are not made by
  division (see #{link_to "When does a division occur?", "#division-occur"})
  and so do not appear on this site.
%h2.faq
  %a{:name => "summaries"}
    Why don’t all the divisions
    have edited summaries?
%p
  When you click on a link for a #{link_to "division", divisions_path},
  you will be taken to a summary that
  will either contain an edited description of the division or text
  taken automatically from the official record of Parliament (known
  as Hansard). In some cases, the summary will contain no text.
%p
  Currently, the divisions with edited summaries are those that
  are relevant to one of the #{link_to "Policies", policies_path}.
  See our #{link_to "Research", help_research_path}
  page to find out more about how the summaries are edited.
%h2.faq
  %a{:name => "policies"}
    What are Policies and how do
    they work?
%p
  On Public Whip, the #{link_to "Policies", policies_path} are
  sets of votes on an issue.
%p
  We choose and develop particular Policies for a number of
  reasons. For example, we prioritise issues where politicians have
  rebelled (e.g. the #{link_to "local government recognition divisions", policy_path(id: 10)})
  or where parties have allowed their members to take a conscience vote
  (e.g. the #{link_to "same sex marriage divisions", policy_path(id: 1)})
  because these divisions give a strong indication of an individual politician’s voting patterns
  (see #{link_to "What are “Rebel Voters” and what is a “Conscience Vote” or “Free Vote”?", "#rebelandfree"}).
  Other reasons for selecting a particular Policy include whether the matter was an
  election issue (e.g. the #{link_to "carbon price", policy_path(id: 3)}) and whether
  there was a high level of attendance
  (see #{link_to "What do the “attendance” and “rebellion” figures mean?", "#clarify"}).
%p
  Unfortunately, Policies are restricted to issues that are voted
  on by division because those are the only decisions that appear on Public Whip
  (see #{link_to "Why don’t all decisions made in Parliament appear on Public Whip?", "#decisions"})
%h2.faq
  %a{:name => "rebelandfree"}
    What are “Rebel Voters” and
    what is a “Conscience Vote” or “Free Vote”?
%p
  An MP or Senator rebels by voting against the #{link_to "party whip", "http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/party-whip.html"}.
  This is known as #{link_to "crossing the floor", "http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/crossing-the-floor.html"}   and rarely occurs these days.
%p
  In contrast, a
  %a{:href => "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience_vote"} conscience vote
  (also known as a free vote) occurs when MPs
  or Senators are not obliged to vote with their party. Conscience votes
  are rare. For example, between 1950 and 2007
  = link_to 'only 32 conscience votes', 'http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp20#_Toc221347466'
  took place. More recently in 2012 and 2013, the legislation related
  to same sex marriage #{link_to 'was decided by conscience vote', policy_path(id: 1)}.
%h2.faq
  %a{:name => "clarify"}
    What do the "attendance" and
    "rebellion" figures mean?
%p
  "Attendance" figures record the politicians who vote in
  any given division.
%p
  There are several reasons why a politician may have low
  attendance figures. For example, they may have abstained, have
  ministerial or other duties or they may be the speaker. Currently,
  the Public Whip does not record if a member spoke in the debate but
  did not vote.
%p
  "Rebellion" figures record the number of rebel votes
  (see #{link_to "What are “Rebel Voters” and what is a “Conscience Vote” or “Free Vote”?", "#rebelandfree"}).
%h2.faq
  %a{:name => "tied-division"}
    What happens if a division is tied?
%p
  In the House of Representatives, the Speaker
  = link_to 'does not vote', 'http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/voting-in-the-chambers.html'
  unless the result is a tie, in which case
  = link_to 'the Speaker has the casting vote', 'http://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/house_of_representatives/powers_practice_and_procedure/~/link.aspx?_id=8485A681FB314882871407C0A81BE62C&_z=z#thesp'
  to decide the matter. Speakers are expected to cast their vote according to
  a set of principles but these have not always been applied consistently (of course!).
%p
  There are also rare cases where the Speaker has not exercised a casting vote.
  For example when a vote that
  = link_to 'requires an absolute majority', 'http://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/house_of_representatives/powers_practice_and_procedure/~/link.aspx?_id=9401351F60524BBF93050639FBA28300&_z=z#abs'
  is tied, the Speaker’s casting vote may not acheive an absolute majority so there’s
  no reason for them to excise that vote.
%p
  In the Senate, the President of the Senate may always vote along with other senators
  so they do not have a casting vote. If a vote in the Senate is tied it is
  = link_to 'considered to have failed', 'http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/voting-in-the-chambers.html'
  because a majority vote has not been reached.
